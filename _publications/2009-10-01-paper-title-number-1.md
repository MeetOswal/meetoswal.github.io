excerpt: 'This paper proposes a middleware solution for storing Internet of Things (IoT) data produced by various sensors, such as traffic, air quality, temperature, and so on, on multiple cloud service providers depending on the type of data. The middleware was created after a comparative study of various existing middleware. The middleware uses the concept of the federal cloud for the purpose of storing data. The solution described in this paper makes it easier to distribute and classify IoT data to various cloud environments based on its type.'

Abstract
------
With the increased emergence of cloud-based services, users are frequently perplexed as to which cloud service to use and whether it will be beneficial to them. The user must compare various services, which can be a time-consuming task if the user is unsure of what they might need for their application. This paper proposes a middleware solution for storing Internet of Things (IoT) data produced by various sensors, such as traffic, air quality, temperature, and so on, on multiple cloud service providers depending on the type of data. Standard cloud computing technologies become insufficient to handle the data as the volume of data generated by smart city devices grows. The middleware was created after a comparative study of various existing middleware. The middleware uses the concept of the federal cloud for the purpose of storing data. The middleware solution described in this paper makes it easier to distribute and classify IoT data to various cloud environments based on its type. The middleware was evaluated using a series of tests, which revealed its ability to properly manage smart city data across multiple cloud environments. Overall, this research contributes to the development of middleware solutions that can improve the management of IoT data in settings such as smart cities.

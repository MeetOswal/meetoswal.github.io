Objective
------
The project aimed to develop a Deep Learning (DL) model for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Indian metropolitan cities. Utilizing a dataset spanning two decades and encompassing multiple cities, the model was trained on diverse atmospheric parameters, including the presence of more than 10 gases in the air. Through rigorous training and validation, the DL model was fine-tuned to effectively forecast the AQI, offering insights into air quality trends and facilitating proactive measures for environmental management and public health protection. This initiative not only addresses the pressing issue of air pollution but also underscores the potential of AI-driven solutions in mitigating environmental challenges on a regional scale.
